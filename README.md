# Home Sales Challenge:

In this challenge, I took help of the class materials. I used PySpark and Spark SQL on Google Colab. Temporary views were created and tables were cached and uncached using Spark.

1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
